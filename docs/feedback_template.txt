[Project Name] | Technical Intelligence Report
Date: December 22, 2025 Architect: Deon P. Verdict: [🟢 KEEP | 🟡 REFACTOR | 🔴 PIVOT]

1. Executive Summary
A high-level briefing for founders and stakeholders.

Objective: Evaluation of the [System Name] repository for architectural stability, AWS alignment, and technical risk.

Key Finding: [One sentence summarizing the biggest risk or strength].

Confidence Score: [e.g., 85%] (Based on test coverage and documentation quality).

2. Structural & Deterministic Analysis
Analysis of the code's internal health using the PatternAuthority framework.

Dependency Graph & Fragility
State: [e.g., Monolithic / Decoupled / Fragmented]

Risk: [e.g., Circular dependencies detected in the core module.]

Observation: [Briefly note if the system follows standard patterns like MVC, Hexagonal, or Layered].

Language Specifics ([Java/Python/TypeScript])
Code Quality: [Observation on naming conventions, type safety, and error handling].

Technical Debt: [Quantifiable issues like deprecated libraries or lack of interfaces].

3. AWS Infrastructure Alignment
Mapping the code to the cloud primitives.

Compute/Orchestration: [e.g., Lambda/EC2/ECS alignment].

Security & IAM: [Critical: Note any "Privilege Escalation" risks or hardcoded credentials].

Networking & Performance: * EFA Check: [Note: High-throughput training clusters require Linux-based EFA nodes. Current alignment is: Optimized/Not Optimized].

Database/Storage: [e.g., RDS/S3 integration efficiency].

4. Risk Hotspots (The "Red Zone")
Specific files or modules that are likely to break during the next feature sprint.

5. The Verdict & Roadmap
[VERDICT: e.g., REFACTOR]
Immediate Next Steps (Next 14 Days):

[Action 1: e.g., Update Node.js runtime to latest LTS]

[Action 2: e.g., Tighten IAM policies to Principle of Least Privilege]

[Action 3: e.g., Implement unit tests for the Payment Gateway]
